In the repo, there are these following files.

-   project-02.Rproj: This is the project environment for this project. **Please open R Studio through this file in order to not have data directory issues.**

-   proposal.qmd: This is the file with a project proposal explaining the idea and plan of attack.

-   index.qmd: This includes the write-up where a discussion of the findings and conclusions will be made.

-   presentation.qmd: This is the quarto file that includes all of the presentation slides.

Under a folder named ***data*** is where all of the data (sourced from the U.S. Department of Transportation) is stored. The data is stored as a **csv file**.

Under the folder ***code***, there will be all the R code files for this project.

Under the folder ***images***, there are pre-rendered images for graphs that take extremely long to render due to needing a lot of computational power. Render pictures as SVG for full quality and all data to be graphed, but take caution regarding file size as it is larger than the GitHub limit.
